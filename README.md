# kirov-street-renaming
Dataset and visualizations for a digital history project on Kirovâ€™s street renaming.

## Description

This project investigates how the urban identity of Kirov (formerly Vyatka) has been shaped through waves of street renaming. It explores the ideological shifts visible in toponymy, from the imperial and ecclesiastical past to the Soviet period and into the post-Soviet memory politics.

The project was created as part of the *Digital and Public Humanities* Masterâ€™s program at Caâ€™ Foscari University of Venice.
